Dear Council Member Sean Chu,     I am writing to share some of my concerns with the proposed bylaw on Banning Conversion Therapy currently being discussed by city council.     I understand and agree that there are abusive and coercive practices that have taken place regarding conversion therapy.  These are unacceptable practices and don’t support an inclusive community that defines the city of Calgary. I am completely supportive of banning abusive and coercive practices that cause harm to any individual.     However, the current wording of the Conversion Therapy bylaw (based on the Edmonton bylaw) concerns me because its broad definition places restrictions on how people can choose to live in accordance to their constitutional freedoms of conscience and religion. Specifically, individuals would not be able to seek support in a manner of their own choosing that is congruent to their desires with regards to their sexuality. For example, this bylaw bans "any tactic" used to "reduce sexual behaviour between members of the same sex."  But prohibition of such a behaviour is a viewpoint shared and practiced for centuries by many of the world's major religions, including Judaism, Christianity, Hinduism, and Islam. The vague definition of the proposed bylaw would therefore cause confusion and restrict the constitutional right of many Calgarians to their own religious freedom. Another example of the shortcomings in the proposed bylaw concerns gender identity. The bylaw only allows for gender transition (through surgery) and would, regrettably, ban any discussion or support for those seeking peace or congruence with their own biological gender.     I support city council's quest to protect vulnerable people from manipulation and abuse. But it is also important that council recognizes the constitutional freedoms of conscience and religions of all its citizens. For this reason, I'm asking that you support a more balanced bylaw that respects the wide opinions of people in the city. I would also invite the council to engage in broader discussions with Calgarians on the bylaw before it is finalized.    In summary, I am apprehensive and concerned of the potential restrictions of Conversion Therapy Ban on the freedoms on associations that provide freedom of choice to those who do want to convert. The City Council must be aware the potential collateral damage and perhaps consider provisions on the bylaw to avoid such freeing bylaw unwittingly be an unfreeing one.     Sincerely,    Jinghua Guan
Apprehensive of the Potential Restrictions of Conversion Therapy Ban on the Freedoms of Associations that provide freedom of choice to those who do want to convert
